## Cohort analysis
* **Cohort analysis** focuses on understanding user behavior over time. It involves grouping users based on shared characteristics (like signup date) and analyzing their actions within that group. This helps identify trends and patterns in user engagement, churn (user drop-off), or purchase behavior.
* Recommender systems focus on predicting user preferences. They use algorithms to analyze user data (past purchases, browsing history) and recommend products or content they might be interested in. 
* in essence, cohort analysis helps you understand how users interact with your product or service, while recommender systems leverage that understanding to personalize user experiences
* While cohort analysis is primarily unsupervised, it can sometimes be combined with supervised learning techniques for further analysis. 
* from a cohort analysis we can answer questions like:
    1. user behavior are you interested in (e.g., retention, purchase frequency)
    2. identify churn points ( churn points refer to specific moments in a user's lifecycle where they are at a heightened risk of cancelling a subscription, stopping using a product, or otherwise disengaging from a service)
    3. How can we improve user engagement
