* One-Sample T-Test - The one-sample t-test is used to determine whether the mean of a single sample is significantly different from a known or hypothesized population mean.
    * State the null hypothesis (H0): The sample mean is equal to the population mean.
    * State the alternative hypothesis (Ha): The sample mean is not equal to the population mean.
    * Calculate the t-statistic and compare it to the critical value from the t-distribution.
* One-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) - One-way ANOVA is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups.
* Two-Sample T-Test (Independent T-Test) - The two-sample t-test is used to determine whether the means of two independent (unrelated) groups are significantly different from each other.
